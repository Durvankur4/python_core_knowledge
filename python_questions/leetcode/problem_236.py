# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# # Solution:
# # Definition for a binary tree node.
# # class TreeNode:
# #     def __init__(self, x):
# #         self.val = x
# #         self.left = None
# #         self.right = None

# class Solution:
#     def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':

#         def dfs(node):
#             if not node :
#                 return

#             if node == p or node == q:
#                 return node

#             left = dfs(node.left)
#             right = dfs(node.right)

#             if left and right :
#                 return node

#             return left if left else right

#         return dfs(root)


# # time complexity = O(n)
# # space complexity = O(n)
